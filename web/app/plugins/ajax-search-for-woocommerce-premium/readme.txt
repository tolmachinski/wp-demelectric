The most popular WooCommerce product search plugin. Gives your users a well-designed advanced AJAX search bar with live search suggestions.

== Description ==

The most popular **WooCommerce product search plugin**. It gives your users a well-designed advanced AJAX search bar with live search suggestions.

By default, WooCommerce provides a very simple search solution, without live product search or even SKU search. FiboSearch (formerly Ajax Search for WooCommerce) provides advanced search with live suggestions.

Who doesn’t love instant, as-you-type suggestions? In 2021, customers expect smart product search. Baymard Institute’s latest UX research reveals that search autocomplete, auto-suggest, or an instant search feature **is now offered on 96% of major e-commerce sites**. It's a must-have feature for every online business that can’t afford to lose customers. Why? FiboSearch helps users save time and makes shopping easier. As a result, Fibo really boosts sales.

*  Storefront
*  Divi

= Who is the Pro plugin version for? =
The Pro plugin version is for all online sellers looking to **increase sales** by providing an ultra-fast smart search engine to their clients.

The main difference between the Pro and Free versions is search speed and search scope. The Pro version has a new fast smart search engine. For some online stores that offer a lot of products for sale, search speed can be increased **up to 10×**, providing a whole new experience to end users.

All in all, the Pro version is dedicated to all WooCommerce shops where autocomplete suggestions work too slowly.
